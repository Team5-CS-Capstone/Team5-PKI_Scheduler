# CS-Capstone

A **Vue 3** application built to help class coordinators streamline the scheduling process. Class coordinators can:

1. **Import a CSV schedule** for the semester and automatically detect classes that exceed room capacity.  
2. **Reassign classes** to more suitable rooms, either through basic swaps or a multi-chain process if simple swaps are not feasible.  
3. **Edit class information**, such as enrollment capacity, student enrollment, instructor, time, and section details.  
4. **Export a revised CSV** file reflecting all changes made within the application.

By offering different reassignment strategies and real-time warnings for over-enrolled courses, the application simplifies the coordinator's task of ensuring every class is assigned to a properly sized room.

## ðŸš€ Start Application
1. **Clone the repository:**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/zkak345/Team5-PKI_Scheduler.git
cd Team5-PKI_Scheduler
```

2. Install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

4. Activate Virtual Env:
```sh
cd python-db
.\flask_venv\Scripts\Activate
```

5. Populate database:
```sh
python import_csv_to_table.py 
```

6. Run backend (flask)
```sh
python app.py
```

7. Run application
```sh
cd ..
cd my-vue-app
npm run dev
```


## Styling with Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is already configured via @tailwindcss/vite.

Simply use Tailwind utility classes in Vue components.

Docs: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite

## Working with Backend
Everything backend/database related is stored within the ./python_db folder so cd into that folder before anything.
A shared virtual environment exists within this folder that we can easily access using the script below:
```sh
.\flask_venv\Scripts\Activate
```
Once in the venv (flask_env), it should be displayed before your terminal current directory
This virtual environment is required as all needed packages for backend development exist for this project

### Run Flask API (app.py)
```sh
python app.py
```
It will run on **http://127.0.0.1:5000** and endpoints for the API will be located within app.py \
Example of an endpoint that takes in a parameter for class ID below:

## API Endpoints
| **Endpoint**       | **Method** | **Description**                       |
|--------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| `/classes`        | `GET`      | Fetch all class details               |
| `/class/<id>`     | `GET`      | Fetch a single class by ID            |


## SQLite Database Installation/Recommendations 
Install [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) here, steps below:
- Click the link and download the precompiled binaries for windows (sqlite-tools-win-x64-3490100.zip)
- Create and put the download into a folder at root level **C:\sqlite**
- Extract the download file into this folder
- Edit your environmental variables, specifically PATH (click, edit, new) and add **C:\sqlite**
- Restart env and possibly computer
To enter the SQLite terminal run:
```sh
sqlite3 database.db
```
Then regular SQL syntax can be used to run commands on the db e.g. (select * from <table_name>) \
SQLite viewer extension for VS Code is also very useful (allows you to open .db files in SQLite form)

## Release Notes
#### Milestone #1:
- The design idea was completed in Figma
- These design ideas were implemented into our application user interface
- Implemented a working and finalized navigation system for the application
- Set up the codebase (vue.js app) including tailwind implementation and SQLite database implementation was started
- CSV file parsing implemented and working properly (within python-db\interaction.py)
- The CSV files themselves are stored within the top level of  the my-vue-app folder.
- Re-usable component implemented for the sidebar navigation
- The implementation of a basic algorithm was unable to be implemented this algorithm as we first will need a connection between our frontend/backend which will be the focus of our next milestone
